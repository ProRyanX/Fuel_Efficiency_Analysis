# 🚗 Fuel Efficiency Analysis

## 📖 Project Overview
The **Fuel Efficiency Analysis** project explores how various car features—such as engine size, horsepower, weight, cylinders, and model year—affect fuel efficiency (measured in miles per gallon, MPG).  
Using Python’s data science libraries, this project aims to uncover key insights through **data visualization** and build a **machine learning model** to predict a vehicle’s fuel efficiency based on its specifications.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze and visualize relationships between car characteristics and fuel efficiency.  
- Identify the most influential factors affecting MPG.  
- Build a predictive regression model using machine learning.  
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations  
- **Pandas** – Data cleaning and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – Visualization and correlation analysis  
- **Scikit-learn (sklearn)** – Preprocessing, model training, and evaluation  

---

## ⚙️ Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using `pandas` and `sklearn.preprocessing`  
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations (scatter plots, heatmaps, pairplots)  
- Feature selection and scaling for model optimization  
- Linear Regression model to predict MPG  
- Model evaluation using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² score**  

---

## 📊 Results
The analysis provides meaningful insights into which car attributes most strongly influence fuel economy and demonstrates how a regression model can effectively predict MPG from numerical and categorical features.
